# FOX Boilerplate

An HTML5 / Sass / Gruntjs Boilerplate including [FOX CSS](http://fox-css.com). Grunt tasks for now :

* `grunt-contrib-compass`
* `grunt-contrib-watch`
* `grunt-contrib-uglify`
* `grunt-contrib-jshint`
* `grunt-contrib-concat`
* `matchdep`

The Boilerplate is currently composed of the following :

* HTML5 responsive base template
* FOX CSS framework (Sass)
* Sass & Compass (compile on default task)
* Livereload with Chrome plugin
* Concatenation and minification of a `main.js` file on `js` task

And more to come.
